# Schwa Industries Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared across all websites, applications, and services ran by Schwa Industries and all of its subsidaries, unless specified otherwise.

## Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via use of our services. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor use it for any purpose other than what it was intended for.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to collect information from a service that you have requested.

## Your Access to and Control Over Information
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via email at contact@schwa.tech:

   • See what data we have about you, if any.

   • Change/correct any data we have about you.

   • Have us delete any data we have about you.

   • Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

## Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

We use several third party services to assist in providing you our services. Please note that we opt-out of any data collection policies that these services may have. You may read their respective privacy policies below:
